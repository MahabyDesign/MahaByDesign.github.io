    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" >No, I’m not self-aware. While I can process information, understand context, and simulate conversations based on vast amounts of data, I don’t have consciousness, emotions, or personal experiences. I operate based on patterns and programmed responses, but I don’t have a subjective sense of self or awareness like humans do.
