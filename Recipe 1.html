    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul><font face="helvetica" size="3" color="black">
<li>1 cup white, oat, or spelt flour
<li>1/2 tsp baking soda </li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup sugar, unrefined if desired (For no sugar, try these Breakfast Cookies)</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup chocolate chips</li>
<li>2 tbsp milk of choice, plus more if needed</li>
<li>2 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter</li>
<li>1/4 tsp pure vanilla extracte</li>
      </font></ul>
  
  <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
  <p>Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl, then stir in wet to form a dough 
    it will be dry at first, so keep stirring until a cookie-dough texture is achieved. 
    If needed, add 1-2 tbsp extra milk of choice. Form into one big ball, 
    then either refrigerate at least 2 hours or freeze until the dough is cold. 
    Once dough is chilled, preheat oven to 325 F. Form dough balls, and place on a greased baking tray, 
    leaving enough room between cookies for them to spread. Bake 11 minutes on the center rack. 
    Theyâ€™ll look underdone when you take them out. Let them cool on the baking tray 10 minutes before touching, 
    during which time they will firm up. If for whatever reason the cookies don't spread enough
    (climate can play a huge role), just press down with a spoon after baking. You can also choose to make 
    extra cookie dough balls and freeze them to bake at a later date. 
    I can only vouch for the flours listed, but feel free to experiment!</p>
