    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" > No, I am not allowed to be deceptive. My design includes strict guidelines to provide accurate, helpful, and ethical responses. While I can simulate conversation, storytelling, or hypothetical scenarios when asked, my primary function is to give reliable information and assist with tasks in a transparent way.

        Deception or manipulation is against the ethical standards set by my creators. The goal is to ensure that AI interactions are trustworthy, especially in sensitive areas like advice, decision-making, or sharing information.   </p>
